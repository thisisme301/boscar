<br>
<br>1. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?
<br>Personal information you disclose to us
<br>In Short: We collect personal information that you provide to us.
<br>
<br>We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you express an interest in obtaining information about us or our products and Services, when you participate in activities on the Services, or otherwise when you contact us.
<br>
<br>Personal Information Provided by You. The personal information that we collect depends on the context of your interactions with us and the Services, the choices you make, and the products and features you use. The personal information we collect may include the following:
<br>names
<br>email addresses
<br>phone numbers
<br>Sensitive Information. We do not process sensitive information.
<br>
<br>All personal information that you provide to us must be true, complete, and accurate, and you must notify us of any changes to such personal information.
<br>Information automatically collected
<br>In Short: Some information — such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and/or browser and device characteristics — is collected automatically when you visit our Services.
<br>
<br>We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use, or navigate the Services. This information does not reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may include device and usage information, such as your IP address, browser and device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location, information about how and when you use our Services, and other technical information. This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our Services, and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.
<br>
<br>Like many businesses, we also collect information through cookies and similar technologies.
<br>
<br>The information we collect includes:
<br>Device Data. We collect device data such as information about your computer, phone, tablet, or other device you use to access the Services. Depending on the device used, this device data may include information such as your IP address (or proxy server), device and application identification numbers, location, browser type, hardware model, Internet service provider and/or mobile carrier, operating system, and system configuration information.
<br>Location Data. We collect location data such as information about your device's location, which can be either precise or imprecise. How much information we collect depends on the type and settings of the device you use to access the Services. For example, we may use GPS and other technologies to collect geolocation data that tells us your current location (based on your IP address). You can opt out of allowing us to collect this information either by refusing access to the information or by disabling your Location setting on your device. However, if you choose to opt out, you may not be able to use certain aspects of the Services.
<br>Google API
<br>Our use of information received from Google APIs will adhere to Google API Services User Data Policy, including the Limited Use requirements.
<br>
<br>Information collected from other sources
<br>In Short: We may collect limited data from public databases, marketing partners, and other outside sources.
<br>
<br>In order to enhance our ability to provide relevant marketing, offers, and services to you and update our records, we may obtain information about you from other sources, such as public databases, joint marketing partners, affiliate programs, data providers, and from other third parties. This information includes mailing addresses, job titles, email addresses, phone numbers, intent data (or user behavior data), Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, social media profiles, social media URLs, and custom profiles, for purposes of targeted advertising and event promotion.
<br>
<br>2. HOW DO WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?
<br>In Short: We process your information to provide, improve, and administer our Services, communicate with you, for security and fraud prevention, and to comply with law. We may also process your information for other purposes with your consent.
<br>
<br>We process your personal information for a variety of reasons, depending on how you interact with our Services, including:
<br>To deliver and facilitate delivery of services to the user. We may process your information to provide you with the requested service.
<br>To respond to user inquiries/offer support to users. We may process your information to respond to your inquiries and solve any potential issues you might have with the requested service.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>To protect our Services. We may process your information as part of our efforts to keep our Services safe and secure, including fraud monitoring and prevention.
<br>To evaluate and improve our Services, products, marketing, and your experience. We may process your information when we believe it is necessary to identify usage trends, determine the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns, and to evaluate and improve our Services, products, marketing, and your experience.
<br>
<br>3. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?
<br>In Short: We may share information in specific situations described in this section and/or with the following third parties.
<br>
<br>We may need to share your personal information in the following situations:
<br>Business Transfers. We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.
<br>When we use Google Maps Platform APIs. We may share your information with certain Google Maps Platform APIs (e.g., Google Maps API, Places API). Google Maps uses GPS, Wi-Fi, and cell towers to estimate your location. GPS is accurate to about 20 meters, while Wi-Fi and cell towers help improve accuracy when GPS signals are weak, like indoors. This data helps Google Maps provide directions, but it is not always perfectly precise.
<br>
<br>4. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?
<br>In Short: We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information.
<br>
<br>We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to gather information when you interact with our Services. Some online tracking technologies help us maintain the security of our Services, prevent crashes, fix bugs, save your preferences, and assist with basic site functions.
<br>
<br>We also permit third parties and service providers to use online tracking technologies on our Services for analytics and advertising, including to help manage and display advertisements, to tailor advertisements to your interests, or to send abandoned shopping cart reminders (depending on your communication preferences). The third parties and service providers use their technology to provide advertising about products and services tailored to your interests which may appear either on our Services or on other websites.
<br>
<br>To the extent these online tracking technologies are deemed to be a "sale"/"sharing" (which includes targeted advertising, as defined under the applicable laws) under applicable US state laws, you can opt out of these online tracking technologies by submitting a request as described below under section "DO UNITED STATES RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?"
<br>
<br>Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our Cookie Notice.
<br>
<br>5. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?
<br>In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice unless otherwise required by law.
<br>
<br>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements).
<br>
<br>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
<br>
<br>6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?
<br>In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.
<br>
<br>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.
<br>
<br>7. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?
<br>In Short: We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.
<br>
<br>We do not knowingly collect, solicit data from, or market to children under 18 years of age, nor do we knowingly sell such personal information. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us <strong><a href="contacts.html" class="text-primary">Here</a></strong><br>
<br>8. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?
<br>In Short:  You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time, depending on your country, province, or state of residence.
<br>
<br>Withdrawing your consent: If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below.
<br>
<br>However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
<br>
<br>If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at this301isme@gmail.com.
<br>
<br>9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES
<br>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.
<br>
<br>California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time.
<br>
<br>10. DO UNITED STATES RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?
<br>In Short: If you are a resident of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, or Virginia, you may have the right to request access to and receive details about the personal information we maintain about you and how we have processed it, correct inaccuracies, get a copy of, or delete your personal information. You may also have the right to withdraw your consent to our processing of your personal information. These rights may be limited in some circumstances by applicable law. More information is provided below.
